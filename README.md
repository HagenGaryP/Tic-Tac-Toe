# Tic-Tac-Toe
Quick and simple game of tic tac toe, using Python.

This was a project from Jose Portilla's Udemy course, "Complete Python Bootcamp," that I had taken last year.

I found it to be very helpful in understanding how programs are meant to be created.
It shows the step by step process of making each function necessary for all the aspects of the game.
Then the logic part comes, where the functions are being put to use to let this game unfold correctly.

Planning out all the tasks for a program isn't always going to be as easy as this simple game, but this
definitely provided a foundation for my approach.  Brainstorm and create functions, then code the logic while 
testing your work along the way.
